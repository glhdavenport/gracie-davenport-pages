Hi! I’m a Python-focused Software Engineer driven by my passion for delivering results and helping teams work well together. I love taking on projects that are focused on the needs of the user and collaborating with team members to deliver wins that move us forward. I have written apps that orchestrate complex interactions between many systems, some internal and some external, and am experienced in helping engineering teams plan and manage their work.

## WORK EXPERIENCE

### Golden Fields Elementary - Computer Science and S.T.E.M. Teacher
##### August 2023 - Current
While putting my career in software on hold, my kids' school posted an opening for a part time S.T.E.M. teacher. I felt like this was a great opportunity for me to continue to prioritize my kids and share my love of science, math and coding with other children in my community.

### Self Employed, SLC UT — Stay at Home Mom
##### December 2022 - August 2023
I shifted my priorities and took time to stay home with my part-time kindergartner for the second half of the school year, and with both my kids over summer break. I was able to support my kids with their tricky subjects, reading for one and math for the other, and volunteered in their classrooms. Over the summer we hiked, camped, swam, biked, played video games, read together, and took a road trip to Bend, Oregon.

I also volunteered with my local chapter of **Girls Who Code** (and let me just say this: they are brilliant!)

### SoFi, Murray UT — Software Engineer, Engineering Enablement
##### September 2020 - December 2022
- Developed a one-touch tool to bootstrap Gitlab projects with boilerplate application code, observability integrations, build and test workflows, and the **Kubernetes** delivery pipelines. Saved engineers days of effort when initiating new projects and centralized configuration management across our **Gitlab** repositories.
- Enabled a pattern for teams to self service their **Argo CD** configurations. This eliminated a bottleneck of our team serving as a gatekeeper to deployment changes.
- Wrote an automated tool to reduce overhead when working with complex sets of **Kustomize** manifest files. One important feature was the ability to migrate running Kubernetes **Deployments** to Argo CD **Rollouts**, paving the way for **progressive delivery** patterns at SoFi.
- Defined and implemented SRE golden metrics for services at SoFi leveraging the capabilities of **Datadog**. This was managed by **Terraform** and triggered through our GitLab pipelines. Teams could establish and monitor their **SLIs/SLOs** by incorporating essential observability metrics as baselines.
- Proactively **mentored** new and junior team members by providing clear task guidance and promoting strong practices such as **Test-Driven Development** (TDD) and iterative changes during pairing sessions. Focused on fostering their curiosity, encouraging growth, and ensuring they land in a **supportive learning environment** on our team.
- Maintained a **Python** app that played a crucial role in every deployment pipeline at SoFi. Tasks included validating the commit range, ensuring compliant MR approvals, and validating the Kubernetes manifests and Argo CD configuration. This enabled a **policy driven** approach for automating what changes were allowed in our ecosystem.-
- Initiated and led an **Employee Resource Group** supporting employees with disabilities and/or caregivers. Built a strong community with diverse participation. Responsibilities included meeting with the executive sponsor, organizing agendas, inviting guest speakers, and preparing presentations for town halls to raise awareness.

### Utah Interactive, SLC UT — Web Developer
##### August 2018 - August 2020
- Collaborated with our project management team and state agencies to identify and implement new features, resolve bugs, and address technical debt across various Utah.gov services. These services included Renewal Express, GovPay, and an embedded shopping cart application.
- Web services were built with Java 8, Groovy, SpringBoot, Maven and SQL - all apps were MVC architecture.

### Self Employed, SLC UT — Stay at Home Mom
##### May 2016 - August 2018
By day I was a manager, a coach, a teacher, a cook, a housekeeper, on call 24/7 for two tiny humans. By night, I was a student pursuing a computer science degree.

### Utah Interactive, SLC UT — Technical Support
##### August 2014 - May 2016
Provided technical support for over 150 Utah.gov web services via email, chat and telephone. Triaged issues with end users, identified and reported bugs via Jira to the development team.
Talking with end users each day helped me to develop a sense for good user experience which is something that I think about before I start writing code - even as a backend developer.
